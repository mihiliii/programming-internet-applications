# Healthcare Management System

A full-stack web application for managing medical appointments, doctor-patient interactions, and healthcare facility administration. Built with Angular and Node.js/Express with TypeScript.

## Overview

This healthcare management system provides a comprehensive platform for three types of users:

- **Patients (Pacijenti)**: Schedule appointments, view medical history, search for doctors
- **Doctors (Lekari)**: Manage appointments, update patient records, create medical reports
- **Managers (Menadžeri)**: Administer system, manage users, oversee facility operations

## Architecture

### Backend

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Port**: 4000
- **API**: RESTful architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Angular 14
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS
- **Port**: 4200 (default Angular dev server)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (v4.0 or higher)
